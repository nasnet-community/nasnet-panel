# Alert Sound Assets

This directory contains sound files for in-app alert notifications.

## Sound Files

- `alert-critical.mp3` - Urgent alert sound (target: <50KB)
- `alert-warning.mp3` - Warning chime sound (target: <50KB)
- `alert-info.mp3` - Subtle beep sound (target: <50KB)

## Requirements

- Each file must be under 50KB
- MP3 format for browser compatibility
- Sounds should be:
  - Short duration (0.5-1.5 seconds)
  - Clear and distinct for each severity level
  - Not jarring or annoying for repeated playback

## Production Sources

For production deployment, source sounds from royalty-free libraries:
- [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org) - Creative Commons sounds
- [Zapsplat.com](https://www.zapsplat.com) - Free sound effects
- [Mixkit.co](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/) - Free sound effects

## Current Status

**TODO**: Replace placeholder files with actual optimized alert sounds before production deployment.
