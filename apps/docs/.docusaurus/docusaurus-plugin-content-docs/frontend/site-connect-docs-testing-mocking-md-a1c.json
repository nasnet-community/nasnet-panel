  "description": "NasNetConnect uses MSW (Mock Service Worker) as the single mocking layer for all network requests — GraphQL and REST alike. MSW intercepts requests at the network level (using a service worker in the browser, and a Node.js interceptor in Vitest). This means tests exercise real Apollo Client logic, real fetch calls, and real response parsing — only the network boundary is replaced with controlled fixtures.",
