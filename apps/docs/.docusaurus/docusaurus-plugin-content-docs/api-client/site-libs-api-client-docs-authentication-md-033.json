  "description": "NasNetConnect uses two parallel authentication systems that operate independently: an Apollo auth link for GraphQL operations and an Axios interceptor for REST API calls. Both systems share the same JWT-first, Basic-fallback priority but differ in credential storage scope — the Apollo link uses per-router sessionStorage keys while the Axios interceptor uses a global localStorage key. Authentication for WebSocket subscriptions is handled separately via connectionParams on every connect/reconnect cycle.",
