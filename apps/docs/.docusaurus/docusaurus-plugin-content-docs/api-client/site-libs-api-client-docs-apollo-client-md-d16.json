  "description": "This document covers the complete Apollo Client infrastructure in libs/api-client/core/src/apollo/. The Apollo layer handles all GraphQL communication: queries, mutations, and real-time subscriptions via WebSocket. It provides an intelligent link chain, a carefully tuned normalized cache, offline-first cache persistence, and React provider integration for both production and test environments.",
