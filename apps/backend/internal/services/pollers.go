// Package services provides backward-compatible type aliases for the pollers sub-package.
//
// DEPRECATED: This file is no longer used. All poller type aliases and constants
// have been moved to aliases.go for better organization. This file is retained
// as a placeholder to prevent accidental re-additions of duplicate content.
//
// Migration path: If you need pollers functionality, import from services package
// and use the aliases defined in aliases.go, or import directly from the
// internal/services/pollers sub-package.
