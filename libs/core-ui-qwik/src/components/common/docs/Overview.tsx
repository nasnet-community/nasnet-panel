        The common module provides essential utilities, types, and components that are shared across
        the entire application. These foundational elements ensure consistency, accessibility, and
        developer efficiency throughout your codebase.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        At its core, the module includes the VisuallyHidden component for accessibility, a
        comprehensive set of TypeScript type definitions, and utility functions that solve common
        development challenges. All utilities are optimized for performance and support both light
        and dark themes.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        These utilities follow mobile-first design principles and are fully responsive, ensuring
        your application works seamlessly across all devices. They integrate perfectly with
        Tailwind CSS and Qwik's reactive system, providing a solid foundation for building modern,
        accessible web applications.
