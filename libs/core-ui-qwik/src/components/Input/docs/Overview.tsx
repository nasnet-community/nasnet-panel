      <p>
        The Input component is a versatile, accessible form input that supports
        multiple input types, validation states, and responsive design patterns.
        It's built with modern web standards and includes comprehensive
        accessibility features, making it suitable for all types of applications.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        The component includes both a standard Input component for text-based
        inputs and a RadioInput component for radio button groups. Both
        components share consistent design patterns, validation states, and
        accessibility features while being optimized for their specific use cases.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        With support for prefix and suffix slots, you can easily add icons,
        buttons, or other content to enhance the user experience. The component
        automatically handles focus states, validation feedback, and responsive
        behavior across all device types.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        Built with Tailwind CSS and following the design system's color palette,
        the Input component seamlessly integrates with both light and dark themes.
        RTL language support ensures the component works correctly in
        international applications.
