      <p>
        The Image component is an enhanced replacement for the standard HTML img
        element, providing advanced features like lazy loading, placeholder
        states, error handling, and responsive image support. It's designed to
        improve both user experience and website performance by progressively
        loading images and providing visual feedback during the loading process.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        Built with modern web standards, the component supports responsive
        images through srcset and picture elements, enabling optimal image
        delivery across different devices and screen sizes. The lazy loading
        implementation uses intersection observer for efficient resource
        management, only loading images when they enter the viewport.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        Error handling is built-in with automatic retry functionality and
        fallback image support, ensuring a robust user experience even when
        network conditions are poor or image sources are unavailable. The
        component also includes comprehensive accessibility features and
        performance optimizations like priority loading for critical images.
