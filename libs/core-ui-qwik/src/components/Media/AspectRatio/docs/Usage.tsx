      <p>
        The AspectRatio component is a powerful tool for creating consistent,
        responsive layouts that maintain their proportions across different
        screen sizes. It's particularly valuable for media content, card
        layouts, and any design that requires specific width-to-height
        relationships.

        This guide covers best practices for choosing appropriate ratios,
        handling content overflow, and maintaining accessibility while using
        aspect ratio constraints. Following these guidelines will ensure your

        devices.
