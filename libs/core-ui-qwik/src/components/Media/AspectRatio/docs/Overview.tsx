      <p>
        The AspectRatio component maintains a specific width-to-height ratio for
        its content, ensuring consistent proportions across different screen
        sizes and container widths. It uses the percentage-based padding
        technique to create intrinsic aspect ratios that work reliably across
        all browsers and devices.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        With seven built-in presets covering common use cases like video (16:9),
        square (1:1), and photo (3:2) ratios, the component handles most design
        requirements out of the box. For specific needs, custom ratios can be
        defined using precise numeric values, giving designers complete control
        over proportions.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        The component is particularly useful for responsive designs where
        content needs to maintain consistent proportions regardless of screen
        size. It handles content overflow intelligently with different modes,
        ensures proper centering, and provides size constraints to prevent
        elements from becoming too large or small on extreme screen sizes.
