# Spinner

The Spinner component indicates a loading or processing state, providing visual feedback to users while content or actions are being loaded or processed.

## Overview

Spinners are essential UI elements that communicate to users that something is happening in the background. They provide reassurance that the system is working and help manage user expectations during waiting periods.

## Features

- Six size options (inline, xs, sm, md, lg, xl)
- Various color options with semantic meanings
- Five visual variants (border, grow, dots, bars, circle)
- Customizable animation speed
- Support for labels with positioning options
- Easy centering within containers
- Full accessibility support
- Inline size perfect for buttons and inline text

## Accessibility

The Spinner component follows accessibility best practices:

- Uses `role="status"` to properly identify the element as a status indicator
- Includes `aria-label` to provide an accessible name
- Maintains sufficient color contrast for all variants
- Provides a textual alternative through optional labels
- Avoids animations that may cause issues for users with vestibular disorders by using reasonable animation speeds

## Best Practices

1. **Use Appropriate Sizes**: Choose spinner sizes that match the scale of the UI element being loaded. Use the "inline" size for buttons and inline text, smaller spinners (xs, sm) for component-level loading, and larger ones (md, lg, xl) for page-level loading.

2. **Provide Context**: When possible, include descriptive text with spinners to explain what's happening.

3. **Set Expectations**: For longer operations, consider using progress bars instead of spinners to give users a sense of how long the operation will take.

4. **Placement**: Position spinners where the content will appear after loading, helping users understand what's being loaded.

5. **Avoid Overuse**: Don't use multiple spinners in close proximity as this can create visual noise and confusion.

6. **Consider Animation Speed**: Fast animations can appear urgent or stressful, while slow animations can suggest sluggishness. Choose speeds appropriate to your context.

7. **Color Semantics**: Use colors that align with your application's color system, but avoid using colors that might imply success or error for neutral loading states.

## Implementation Notes

- The Border variant is the most lightweight option and works well in most contexts.
- SVG-based variants (like Circle) offer the most control over appearance but may be slightly more resource-intensive.
- Animation performances are optimized using CSS animations rather than JavaScript-based animations.
- For custom animation speeds, use values between 500ms (fast) and 3000ms (slow). Values outside this range may create poor visual effects.
