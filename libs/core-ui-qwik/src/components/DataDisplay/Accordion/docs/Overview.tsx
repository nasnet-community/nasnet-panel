        The Accordion component provides a way to organize content into
        collapsible sections, allowing users to show or hide information as
        needed. It helps manage complex content by breaking it into digestible,
        focused sections that users can navigate easily.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-4">
        Built with accessibility in mind, the Accordion follows WAI-ARIA best
        practices with proper keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen
        reader announcements. The component consists of four parts:{" "}
        <code>Accordion</code> (the container), <code>AccordionItem</code>{" "}
        (individual sections),
        <code>AccordionTrigger</code> (clickable headers), and{" "}
        <code>AccordionContent</code> (expandable content areas).
      </p>
    </OverviewTemplate>
