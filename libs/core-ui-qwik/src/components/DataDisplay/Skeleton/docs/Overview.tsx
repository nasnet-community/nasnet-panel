      <p>
        The Skeleton component provides placeholder animations while content is
        loading, improving perceived performance and preventing layout shift.
        It helps maintain a smooth user experience by showing the approximate
        structure of content before it's fully loaded.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        Skeleton components come in various pre-built shapes like text lines,
        avatars, and cards, but can also be customized to match any content
        structure. The component uses subtle animations to indicate loading
        state while being optimized for performance across all devices.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        With built-in dark mode support and mobile optimization, skeleton
        loaders automatically adapt to different themes and screen sizes. They
        provide a seamless transition from loading to loaded state, enhancing
        the overall user experience.
