      <h3 class="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Implementation Guidelines</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Cards are versatile components that can be used in various contexts
        throughout your application. When implementing cards, consider the
        following guidelines to ensure they're used effectively:
      </p>

      <h4 class="mb-1 mt-4 font-medium">Content Structure</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Cards should follow a consistent content structure to make them easy to
        scan and understand:
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-4 ml-6 list-disc">
        <li>
          Start with a clear, concise header that describes the card's content
        </li>
        <li>Use the body for more detailed information</li>
        <li>Place actions in the footer for easy discovery</li>
        <li>
          When using media, ensure it enhances rather than distracts from the
          content
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="mb-1 mt-4 font-medium">Visual Hierarchy</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Establish a clear visual hierarchy within and across cards:
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-4 ml-6 list-disc">
        <li>
          Use consistent typography styles for similar content across cards
        </li>
        <li>Apply sufficient contrast between the card and its background</li>
        <li>Use elevation thoughtfully to create depth when needed</li>
        <li>Group related cards visually through spacing and alignment</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="mb-1 mt-4 font-medium">Interaction Design</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">
        When cards are interactive, make their behavior clear to users:
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-4 ml-6 list-disc">
        <li>Use hover effects to indicate interactivity</li>
        <li>
          Be consistent with interaction patterns (e.g., if one product card
          links to a detail page, all similar cards should behave the same way)
        </li>
        <li>
          For cards with multiple interactive elements, ensure each element has
          a clear purpose
        </li>
        <li>
          Consider using the entire card as a clickable target for the primary
          action
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="mb-1 mt-4 font-medium">Responsive Behavior</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Design cards to work well across different screen sizes:
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-4 ml-6 list-disc">
        <li>Use grid layouts that reflow based on screen width</li>
        <li>Consider stacking cards vertically on smaller screens</li>
        <li>Ensure touch targets are large enough on mobile devices</li>
        <li>Test card layouts across different breakpoints</li>
      </ul>
    </UsageTemplate>
  );
