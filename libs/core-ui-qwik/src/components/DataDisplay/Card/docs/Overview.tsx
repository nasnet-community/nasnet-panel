      <p>
        The Card component is a flexible container that groups related content
        and actions. It provides a clean, distinct surface for presenting
        information in a visually organized way. Cards can contain various
        elements such as text, images, buttons, and other interactive elements.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        Cards are modular and composable, built with a set of subcomponents:
        CardHeader, CardBody, CardFooter, and CardMedia. This structure makes it
        easy to create consistent card layouts throughout your application with
        appropriate spacing and visual hierarchy.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        With customizable elevation, border radius, and interaction states,
        cards can be tailored to match your design system. They can be static
        information displays or interactive elements that serve as navigation
        links or clickable surfaces that trigger actions.
