      <p>
        The List component is a versatile element for displaying collections of
        items in various formats: unordered lists (bulleted), ordered lists
        (numbered), and definition lists (term-description pairs). Lists are
        fundamental building blocks for organizing and structuring content in a
        way that improves readability and comprehension.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        With configurable marker styles, sizing options, and spacing controls,
        the List component can be tailored to fit different design requirements
        while maintaining visual consistency. The component supports nested
        lists for representing hierarchical data and includes accessibility
        features to ensure all users can navigate and understand list content
        efficiently.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        Lists can be static content displays or interactive elements for
        navigation and selection. The component's flexible design allows it to
        be used across various contexts, from simple bullet points in
        documentation to interactive navigation menus in complex applications.
