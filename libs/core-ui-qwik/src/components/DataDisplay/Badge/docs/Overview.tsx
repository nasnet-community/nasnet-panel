        The Badge component is used to highlight and display short pieces of
        information. Badges can indicate status, categorize items, show counts,
        or emphasize specific attributes in a compact and visually distinct way.

        With multiple variants, colors, and shapes, badges provide a flexible
        way to present contextual information that stands out from surrounding
        content while maintaining visual harmony.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        The component also includes a BadgeGroup variant for organizing multiple
        related badges in a consistent layout with configurable spacing and
        alignment.
