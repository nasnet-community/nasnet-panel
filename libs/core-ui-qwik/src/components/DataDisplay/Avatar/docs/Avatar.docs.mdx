- Different shapes: circle, square, or rounded
- Status indicators for displaying user status
- Bordered option for additional emphasis

## Accessibility

- The Avatar component includes appropriate ARIA attributes for screen readers
- When using interactive avatars, ensure they have meaningful labels
- Status indicators have `aria-hidden="true"` to avoid redundant announcements
- For clickable avatars without text, use `ariaLabel` to provide context

## Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate sizing**: Choose avatar sizes that match their importance in the UI
2. **Provide fallbacks**: Always ensure avatars have fallback content (initials or icon) if images fail to load
3. **Maintain contrast**: Ensure text/background contrast meets accessibility standards
4. **Use meaningful alt text**: When using image avatars, provide descriptive alt text
5. **Limit group size**: When using AvatarGroup, limit the number of visible avatars to avoid cluttering the UI
6. **Status indicators**: Use status indicators sparingly and only when user status is important
7. **Consistent shapes**: Maintain consistent avatar shapes throughout your application for visual harmony

## Implementation Notes

- The Avatar component provides a fallback mechanism when images fail to load, displaying initials or a default icon
- When using initials, provide 1-2 characters for optimal display
- For responsive designs, consider using different avatar sizes at different breakpoints
- The AvatarGroup component automatically handles overlapping avatars and displays a count for additional avatars
