        The Avatar component is used to represent users or entities in the
        interface. It provides a consistent visual identity across the
        application and supports displaying images, initials, or icons with
        various customization options.

        Avatars are an effective way to visually represent users in interfaces
        where space is limited. They help users quickly identify and recognize
        other users or entities while maintaining a clean and consistent UI.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        The component also includes an AvatarGroup variant for displaying
        multiple avatars in a space-efficient manner, with options to limit the
        number displayed and show an overflow indicator.
