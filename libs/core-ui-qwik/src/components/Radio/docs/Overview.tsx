      <p>
        The Radio component enables users to select a single option from a
        predefined set of choices. Radio buttons are grouped together to
        indicate that only one option can be selected at a time, making them
        ideal for mutually exclusive selections.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        Radio buttons can be used individually with the Radio component or
        managed as a group with the RadioGroup component. The RadioGroup
        provides additional features like unified state management, consistent
        styling, helper text, error messages, and simplified keyboard
        navigation.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        The component is designed with accessibility in mind, featuring proper
        labeling, keyboard navigation, and ARIA attributes. It's optimized for
        both desktop and mobile experiences, with touch-friendly target sizes
        and responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        With full theme integration, Radio components automatically adapt to
        light and dark modes, using the application's color scheme for
        consistent visual design. The component supports three size variants to
        accommodate different UI contexts and density requirements.
