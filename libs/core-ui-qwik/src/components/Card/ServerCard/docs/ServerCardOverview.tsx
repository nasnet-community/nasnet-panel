        The ServerCard component is a specialized card designed specifically for
        server and VPN configuration interfaces. It provides a consistent layout
        with built-in toggle functionality for enabling/disabling server
        services.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Built on top of the core Card component, ServerCard includes
        server-specific features like integrated toggle switches, icon support
        for different protocols, and standardized styling for router
        configuration management interfaces.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        This component is particularly useful in network configuration wizards
        where users need to configure multiple server protocols with consistent
        enable/disable controls and visual feedback.
