        The Card component serves as a container for content, providing
        structure and visual grouping. Cards are used to organize and display
        information, making it easier for users to scan and interact with
        related content.

        With support for headers, footers, and action areas, cards provide a
        flexible way to present different types of content with consistent
        styling while maintaining visual hierarchy.
