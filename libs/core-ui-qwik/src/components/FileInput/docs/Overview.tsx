      <p>
        The FileInput module provides specialized components for handling VPN
        configuration files. It includes two main components designed for
        different use cases and complexity levels.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">ConfigFileInput</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">
        A streamlined file input component that provides basic functionality for
        uploading and pasting VPN configuration files. It features a simple
        interface with upload and paste buttons alongside a textarea for manual
        configuration entry.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">VPNConfigFileSection</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">
        An advanced file input component that integrates with FormContainer to
        provide a complete configuration file management section. It includes
        drag-and-drop support, upload progress tracking, and enhanced visual
        feedback for a more sophisticated user experience.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-4">
        Both components are optimized for VPN configuration workflows,
        supporting common formats like .conf, .ovpn, and protocol-specific
        configuration files. They handle the complexities of file reading and
        validation while providing a clean, intuitive interface for users.
