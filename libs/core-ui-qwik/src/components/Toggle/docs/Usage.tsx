      <p>
        The Toggle component provides a simple way to control binary states in
        your application. It follows Qwik's pattern of controlled components,
        where you manage the state and provide an onChange$ handler to update
        it. The component now supports color variants, loading states, icons,
        and responsive sizing for enhanced user experience.

        This guide covers best practices for implementing toggles in your
        interface, with a focus on clear labeling, appropriate usage, 
        accessibility considerations, and leveraging the new features like
        color variants, loading states, and icon integration for better
        user experience and visual communication.
