        The Toggle component provides a visual switch for controlling binary
        states, enabling users to turn options on or off with a simple
        interaction. It serves as a modern alternative to checkboxes when an
        immediate state change is expected, offering a more intuitive and
        touch-friendly interface.

      <p class="mt-2">

        regardless of their input method or assistive technology.

        for settings that take effect as soon as the user changes them. It

        transitions that enhance the user experience.
