      <p>
        The Container component provides a structured wrapper for form sections,
        helping to organize and separate content into logical units. It offers
        consistent spacing, optional borders, and supports titles and
        descriptions for clear labeling.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        By using this component, you can improve the visual hierarchy and
        readability of complex forms, making them easier for users to understand
        and complete. The component also provides proper semantic structure
        through heading elements.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        The Container component supports content through its default slot and
        provides a named "footer" slot for action buttons or additional content
        at the bottom of the container. This makes it ideal for creating form
        sections with consistent action areas.
