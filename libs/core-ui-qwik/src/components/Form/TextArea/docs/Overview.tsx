      <p>
        The TextArea component provides a multi-line text input field for forms.
        It extends the basic HTML textarea with additional features like
        auto-resizing, character counting, and consistent styling with other
        form components.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        This component is ideal for collecting longer form responses where users
        need the freedom to write multiple lines of text. It includes
        accessibility features and integrates seamlessly with the Form component
        for validation and submission handling.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        TextArea maintains the same styling patterns, states, and behaviors as
        other form components, ensuring a consistent experience across your
        application's forms.
