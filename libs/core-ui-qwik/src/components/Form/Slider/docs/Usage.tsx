        The Slider component provides an interactive way for users to select a
        value or range within defined boundaries. It's ideal for adjusting
        settings where the relative position matters more than precise numeric
        input.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Sliders come in two main types: single sliders for selecting a single
        value, and range sliders for selecting a span between two values. They
        can be oriented horizontally or vertically depending on the interface
        requirements and available space.
