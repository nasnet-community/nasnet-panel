        The Slider component provides an interactive control for selecting
        numeric values by dragging a thumb along a track. It offers both
        single-value and range selection modes to accommodate different use
        cases.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Sliders are useful when users need to make adjustments within a defined
        range where the exact value may be less important than the relative
        position. They provide immediate visual feedback and allow users to
        quickly try different values.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        With support for horizontal and vertical orientations, customizable
        marks and ticks, and various visual feedback options, the Slider
        component can be configured to meet diverse interface requirements while
        maintaining accessibility and usability.
