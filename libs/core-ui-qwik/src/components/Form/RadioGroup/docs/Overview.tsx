        The RadioGroup component provides a way for users to select a single
        option from a set of mutually exclusive choices. It manages the
        relationship between radio buttons, ensuring that only one option can be
        selected at a time.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        RadioGroup is ideal for presenting a limited set of options where users
        need to make a single choice. It offers both horizontal and vertical
        layouts to fit different design requirements.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        The component is built with accessibility in mind, ensuring proper
        keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen reader support for all
        users.
