      <p>
        ServerField components provide a way to create form fields for
        server-rendered forms in Connect applications. These components are
        designed for use in scenarios where client-side JavaScript isn't needed
        or available.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        The ServerFormField component handles the layout of a form field
        including labels, input elements, and error messages. It supports both
        vertical (default) and inline layouts, making it suitable for various
        form designs.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Unlike the standard Field component, ServerField components do not
        include client-side validation or interactivity, making them ideal for
        server-rendered forms or static forms where minimal JavaScript is
        preferred.
