      <p>
        The DatePicker component provides a user-friendly interface for
        selecting dates and date ranges. It offers a calendar-based visual
        selection method that's more intuitive than manual date entry, while
        still supporting keyboard input and accessibility features.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        This component supports three distinct modes of operation: single date
        selection, date range selection, and datetime selection. With built-in
        validation, localization options, and flexible styling, it can be
        adapted to various form requirements and design systems.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        The DatePicker is designed to be fully accessible with keyboard
        navigation, proper labeling, and screen reader support, making it usable
        for all users regardless of their abilities.
