      <p>
        The Form component is a foundational element of the Connect design
        system that provides a structured way to collect user input. It includes
        built-in form validation, state management, and integration with Qwik
        City's actions.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Use the Form component to create structured forms with consistent
        validation patterns, error handling, and submission processing. It
        simplifies the process of building complex forms by providing a
        declarative API for defining form fields and their behavior.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        The Form component handles many common form concerns such as field
        registration, validation timing, error messages, and submission
        handling, allowing you to focus on your application's specific business
        logic.
