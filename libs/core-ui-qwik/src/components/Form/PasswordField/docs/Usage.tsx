        The PasswordField component enhances password input with visibility
        toggles and strength indicators, balancing security with usability. This
        specialized input component helps users create and enter passwords while
        providing immediate feedback.

      <p class="mt-2">
        When implementing password fields, focus on providing clear guidance
        through helper text, appropriate error handling, and visual feedback.
        The strength indicator can help users create stronger passwords by
        showing real-time feedback on password quality.
