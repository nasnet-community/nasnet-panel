        The PasswordField component is a specialized input field designed for
        secure password entry. It enhances the standard password input with
        features like visibility toggling and password strength indicators,
        providing both security and usability.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        This component handles the common pattern of allowing users to see what
        they're typing by toggling between password and text input types, which
        helps prevent typing errors while maintaining security. The optional
        strength indicator provides immediate visual feedback to help users
        create stronger passwords.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        PasswordField maintains accessibility through proper labeling, ARIA
        attributes, and keyboard navigation support, ensuring it works for all
        users regardless of ability or assistive technology use.
