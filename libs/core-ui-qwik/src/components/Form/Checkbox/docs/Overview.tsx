        The Checkbox component provides a way to select boolean options in
        forms. It is commonly used for multiple-choice selections where one or
        more options can be selected simultaneously.

      <p class="mt-2">
        Checkboxes can operate independently or be grouped together using the
        CheckboxGroup component. They support various states including checked,
        unchecked, indeterminate, disabled, and error states to communicate
        validation status clearly to users.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        The component is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring proper
        keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen reader compatibility
        for all users.
