        The FormErrorMessage component is designed to clearly communicate
        validation errors in forms. It provides a consistent, accessible way to
        display error messages associated with form fields.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        With support for different sizes, icons, and animation, the
        FormErrorMessage component helps draw user attention to issues that need
        to be corrected before a form can be successfully submitted.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        The component is built with accessibility in mind, ensuring that error
        messages are properly announced to screen readers and can be associated
        with form fields through ARIA attributes.
