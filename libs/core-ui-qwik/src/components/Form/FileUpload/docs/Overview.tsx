      <p>
        The FileUpload component provides a user-friendly interface for
        uploading files within a web application. It combines drag-and-drop
        functionality with traditional file browser selection to accommodate
        different user preferences.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        This component handles the complete file upload lifecycle, including
        selection, validation, preview, upload progress tracking, and
        management. It offers extensive customization options through props for
        different appearance styles, layouts, and behaviors.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        FileUpload supports both automatic and manual upload modes, allowing for
        immediate uploading on file selection or giving users control over when
        to initiate the upload process. With built-in support for file previews,
        progress indicators, and error handling, it provides a comprehensive
        solution for file management in web applications.
