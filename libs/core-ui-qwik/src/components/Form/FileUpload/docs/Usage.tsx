      <p>
        The FileUpload component provides a versatile interface for uploading
        files in web applications. It supports various file validation options,
        display configurations, and upload methods to adapt to different use
        cases.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        When implementing file uploads, consider your users' needs and technical
        constraints. Balance the convenience of features like drag-and-drop and
        auto-upload with performance considerations and accessibility
        requirements. Always implement both client-side and server-side
        validation to ensure security and data integrity.
