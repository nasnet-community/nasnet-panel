      <p>
        The FormLabel component provides a standardized way to label form
        controls in your application. It creates semantic HTML label elements
        that are properly associated with form inputs, enhancing accessibility
        and user experience.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        With support for different sizes, states, and accessibility features,
        FormLabel ensures your forms are both visually consistent and fully
        accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies
        like screen readers.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        The component automatically handles required field indicators and
        provides various visual states to match different validation states of
        your form controls.
      </p>
    </OverviewTemplate>
