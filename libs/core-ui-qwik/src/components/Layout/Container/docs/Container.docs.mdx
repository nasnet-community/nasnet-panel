# Container

The Container component is a layout primitive for constraining content width and providing consistent padding.

## Overview

The Container component helps create a consistent layout across your application by:

- Constraining content width at different breakpoints
- Applying consistent horizontal and vertical padding
- Centering content within the available space
- Creating a cohesive visual hierarchy for page layouts

By using containers, you can ensure that content has appropriate reading widths and consistent margins across different screen sizes.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Container } from '@connect/Core/Layout/Container';

// Basic container with default settings
<Container>
  <p>Your content here...</p>
</Container>

// Container with custom max width and padding
<Container maxWidth="md" paddingX="lg" paddingY="md">
  <p>Content with medium max-width and large horizontal padding</p>
</Container>

// Full width container with no max-width constraint
<Container maxWidth="fluid" paddingX="md">
  <p>Full-width fluid container</p>
</Container>
```

## Examples

### Basic Container

<Primary />

The default Container has a `lg` max-width (512px) and medium horizontal padding.

### Container Sizes

<Story of={ContainerStories.ContainerSizes} />

Containers come in various predefined sizes to accommodate different content needs:

- `xs`: 320px
- `sm`: 384px
- `md`: 448px
- `lg`: 512px (default)
- `xl`: 576px
- `2xl`: 672px
- `full`: 100% of the parent width
- `fluid`: No max-width constraint

### Fixed vs Responsive Width

<Story of={ContainerStories.FixedVsResponsive} />

By default, containers are responsive and only apply their max-width at their target breakpoint and above. This allows content to use the full width of smaller screens.

Setting `fixedWidth={true}` will make the container maintain its max-width at all screen sizes.

### Padding Options

<Story of={ContainerStories.PaddingExamples} />

Control the space between the container's edge and its content:

- **Horizontal Padding** (`paddingX`): Controls the left and right spacing
- **Vertical Padding** (`paddingY`): Controls the top and bottom spacing

Available padding sizes: `none`, `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`

### Centered vs Non-Centered

<Story of={ContainerStories.CenteringExamples} />

By default, containers are centered horizontally within their parent element. Setting `centered={false}` will align the container to the left (or right in RTL languages).

### Nested Containers

Containers can be nested to create more complex layouts with varying content widths.

### Page Layout Example

## Accessibility

The Container component:

- Preserves semantic HTML structure
- Supports ARIA role and label for cases where the container represents a landmark region
- Maintains proper content width for readability
- Works well with both LTR and RTL languages

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the appropriate size**: Select a container size that works well for your content type:

   - Use smaller containers for focused reading content
   - Use larger containers for dashboards or content with multiple columns
   - Use full-width or fluid containers for immersive content or full-bleed layouts

2. **Be consistent**: Use the same container sizes for similar sections throughout your application.

3. **Consider responsive behavior**: For most cases, the default responsive behavior works best, but for special cases, consider using fixed-width containers.

4. **Use padding effectively**: Apply appropriate padding to ensure content doesn't feel cramped or too sparse:

   - Typically, horizontal padding should be larger than vertical padding
   - Consistent padding creates a more cohesive design

5. **Combine with other layout components**: Use Container in combination with Grid, Stack, and Box components to create sophisticated layouts:
   - Container for overall width constraints
   - Grid for multi-column layouts within the container
   - Stack for vertical or horizontal arrangement of elements
   - Box for individual elements with spacing and styling

- **Stack**: A one-dimensional layout component for arranging elements vertically or horizontally
- **Grid**: A two-dimensional layout component for creating grid-based layouts
