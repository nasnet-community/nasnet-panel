      <p>
        The Container component is a fundamental layout building block that
        helps maintain consistent content width and spacing throughout your
        application. When used effectively, it creates a visual rhythm and
        improves readability across different screen sizes.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Containers are most effective when they're used consistently and with
        purpose. By selecting the appropriate size, padding, and alignment
        options, you can create layouts that guide the user's attention and
        organize content effectively.
