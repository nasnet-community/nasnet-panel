      <p>
        The Container component is a fundamental layout element that constrains
        content width and provides consistent padding. It helps maintain
        readability and content structure across different screen sizes by
        setting appropriate maximum widths and spacing.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        Containers are responsive by default, applying their maximum width
        constraints only at the specified breakpoint and above. This ensures
        content remains fluid on smaller screens and properly constrained on
        larger ones. For cases where consistent width is needed across all
        breakpoints, the fixedWidth option provides non-responsive behavior.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        With configurable padding options and automatic centering capabilities,
        the Container component serves as a versatile building block for
        creating consistent, responsive layouts throughout your application.
