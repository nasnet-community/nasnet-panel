      <p>
        Dividers are simple yet effective UI elements that help organize content
        and improve readability. They create visual boundaries between different
        sections, helping users understand the content structure and hierarchy.
        While horizontal dividers are more common, vertical dividers are useful
        for side-by-side content separation.

        Use dividers strategically to enhance your layout without creating
        visual clutter. A well-placed divider can significantly improve the user
        experience by making content easier to scan and understand.
