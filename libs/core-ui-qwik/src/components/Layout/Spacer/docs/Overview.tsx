        The Spacer component is a layout utility that creates consistent
        whitespace between elements. It can be used for vertical or horizontal
        spacing with flexible size options.

      </ul>

      <h3 class="mb-2 mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">Design System Integration</h3>
      <p class="mb-3">
        The Spacer component follows our design system's spacing scale, ensuring
        consistent whitespace across the application. The sizes (xs, sm, md, lg,
        xl, etc.) correspond to predefined spacing values that maintain visual
        harmony.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Spacers are composable with other layout components like Box, Flex, and
        Grid to create complex layouts while maintaining consistent spacing
        patterns.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mb-2 mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">Responsive Behavior</h3>
      <p class="mb-3">
        The Spacer component can adapt its size across different viewport widths
        using the responsive object syntax. This allows for more compact spacing
        on mobile devices and more generous spacing on larger screens.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also completely hide a spacer on mobile screens using the
        hideOnMobile prop, which helps create more efficient layouts on smaller
        devices.
