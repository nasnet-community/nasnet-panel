        The TopNavigation component provides a horizontal navigation bar
        typically positioned at the top of a website or application. It serves
        as the primary navigation interface, allowing users to access the main
        sections of your site at any time.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        With built-in responsive behavior, TopNavigation automatically adjusts
        to different screen sizes, transforming into a mobile-friendly
        navigation menu on smaller devices. The component supports various
        configurations including simple link navigation, dropdown menus for
        nested navigation structures, and can be enhanced with icons and action
        buttons.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        Designed with accessibility in mind, TopNavigation implements proper
        keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes to ensure all users can navigate
        your site effectively. The component is also highly customizable in
        terms of styling and behavior to match your application's design
        language.
