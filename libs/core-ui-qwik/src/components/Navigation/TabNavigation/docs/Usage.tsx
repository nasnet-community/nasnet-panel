      <h3 class="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Implementation Guidelines</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        TabNavigation is designed to organize related content within the same
        context. When implementing tabs in your application, consider the
        following guidelines:
      </p>

      <h4 class="mb-1 mt-4 font-medium">Content Organization</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Group related information into logical sections that make sense to be
        separated into tabs. The content behind each tab should be related to
        the same overall context but represent distinct categories or aspects of
        that context.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mb-1 mt-4 font-medium">Visual Consistency</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Maintain consistent styling of tabs across your application. Choose a
        tab variant that matches your overall design system and stick with it
        throughout the interface unless there's a specific need for
        differentiation.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mb-1 mt-4 font-medium">Performance Considerations</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">
        For content-heavy tab panels, consider lazy loading content only when
        the tab is selected, especially if the content requires data fetching or
        heavy rendering. This can improve the initial load time of your
        interface.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mb-1 mt-4 font-medium">Mobile Responsiveness</h4>
      <p>
        When using tabs on mobile devices, consider how they will behave on
        smaller screens:
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-4 ml-6 list-disc">
        <li>
          For many tabs, consider a scrollable tab bar rather than wrapping to
          multiple lines
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the "stretched" variant on small screens to make tap targets
          larger
        </li>
        <li>
          Consider switching to vertical tabs or an alternative navigation
          pattern if horizontal space is limited
        </li>
      </ul>
    </UsageTemplate>
  );
