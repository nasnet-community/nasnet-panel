      <p>
        The TabNavigation component provides a way to organize and navigate
        between related sections of content within the same view. It creates a
        visually distinct set of tabs that allow users to switch between
        different content panels without navigating to a new page.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        Tabs are an efficient way to present related content in a compact space,
        allowing users to focus on one section at a time. The TabNavigation
        component supports both horizontal (default) and vertical orientations
        to fit different layout requirements.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        Built with accessibility in mind, the TabNavigation component implements
        proper ARIA roles and keyboard navigation, ensuring all users can
        interact with tabbed interfaces effectively. The component can be easily
        customized to match your application's design language through various
        styling options and variants.
