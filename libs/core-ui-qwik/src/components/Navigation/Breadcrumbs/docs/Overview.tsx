        The Breadcrumbs component provides users with hierarchical navigation,
        showing their current location within the application structure. It
        displays a trail of links from the home page to the current page,
        allowing users to easily navigate back to higher-level pages.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        Designed with accessibility in mind, the component follows WAI-ARIA
        guidelines for breadcrumb navigation, ensuring users of assistive
        technologies can understand and navigate the hierarchy. The component
        automatically handles responsive behavior, collapsing middle items when
        screen space is limited.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        Breadcrumbs support various separator styles, icon integration, and can
        be extensively customized to match your application's design language
        while maintaining their navigational utility.
