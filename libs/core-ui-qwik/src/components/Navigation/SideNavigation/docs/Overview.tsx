        The SideNavigation component provides a vertical navigation sidebar that
        organizes links and actions in a hierarchical structure. It's designed
        to handle both simple and complex navigation systems, with support for
        nested items, collapsible sections, icons, and responsive behavior.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        This component is ideal for application dashboards, admin interfaces,
        and content-heavy websites that require organizing navigation items into
        logical groups. The sidebar adapts to different screen sizes,
        transforming into an off-canvas menu on mobile devices to ensure a
        consistent experience across all viewports.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        SideNavigation includes multiple sub-components like SideNavigationItem
        for individual links, SideNavigationHeader for branding and custom
        content, and SideNavigationBackdrop for mobile overlay effects. These
        components work together to create a cohesive navigation system that can
        be customized to match your application's needs.
