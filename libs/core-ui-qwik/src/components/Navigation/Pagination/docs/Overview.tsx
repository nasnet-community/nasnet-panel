        The Pagination component provides a user-friendly interface for
        navigating through multi-page content. It helps users browse through
        large datasets by dividing content into manageable pages and providing
        intuitive navigation controls.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        The component offers multiple navigation methods, including
        next/previous buttons, clickable page numbers, and direct page input.
        It's designed to be accessible, with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard
        navigation support to ensure all users can effectively navigate
        paginated content.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        Pagination automatically adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a
        consistent user experience across devices. The component also supports
        customizable page size options, allowing users to control how much
        content is displayed per page.
