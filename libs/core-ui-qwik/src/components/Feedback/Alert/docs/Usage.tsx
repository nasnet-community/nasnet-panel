      <p>
        Alerts are an important part of your application's communication system.
        They help inform users about the status of operations, provide feedback
        on actions, and highlight important information that requires attention.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        When used appropriately, alerts enhance the user experience by providing
        timely, relevant, and contextual information. However, overuse or misuse
        of alerts can lead to alert fatigue, where users start ignoring these
        important messages.
