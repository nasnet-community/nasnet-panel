      <p>
        The Alert component is designed to communicate important information,
        status updates, or feedback messages to users. It provides a consistent
        and accessible way to draw attention to content that requires immediate
        awareness, from success confirmations to critical warnings.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        With support for multiple visual styles, sizes, and behaviors, the Alert
        component can be tailored to match the importance and context of the
        message being displayed. The component intelligently handles dismissal,
        either manually through a close button or automatically after a
        specified duration.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        Each alert status (info, success, warning, error) comes with appropriate
        default styling and icons, but these can be customized to align with
        your application's design language while maintaining accessibility and
        user experience best practices.
