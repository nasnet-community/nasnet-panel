      <p>
        The Dialog component creates an overlay element that displays content in
        a layer above the page, interrupting the user's workflow to capture
        attention or gather input. It follows accessibility best practices by
        managing focus, providing keyboard navigation, and ensuring screen
        reader compatibility.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        Dialogs are structured with optional header, body, and footer sections,
        making them versatile for various use cases from simple alerts to
        complex forms. The component handles the backdrop, positioning,
        animations, and accessibility concerns, letting you focus on the
        content.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        The component is fully responsive, automatically adapting to different
        screen sizes. On mobile devices, dialogs switch to fullscreen mode with
        optimized animations and touch-friendly controls. The implementation
        uses theme utilities for consistent styling, proper surface elevation,
        and backdrop effects that enhance the visual hierarchy.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        With features like customizable sizes, scrollable content areas,
        controlled focus management, and mobile-specific optimizations, the
        Dialog component provides a complete solution for creating modal
        interfaces that work seamlessly across all devices and input methods
        while maintaining a consistent, accessible user experience.
