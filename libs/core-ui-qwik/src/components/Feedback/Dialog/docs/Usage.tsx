      <p>
        Dialogs are powerful UI elements that temporarily interrupt the user's
        current task to focus their attention on critical information or
        actions. When implemented thoughtfully, dialogs can enhance the user
        experience by providing clear context and focused interactions.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        However, because dialogs are disruptive by nature, it's important to use
        them judiciously and follow best practices to ensure they enhance rather
        than hinder the user experience. The guidelines below will help you
        implement dialogs effectively in your application.
