      <p>
        Dialogs are powerful components for capturing user attention and
        gathering focused input. They create a layer above the current page,
        temporarily interrupting the workflow to present important information
        or request user action.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        The examples below demonstrate the versatility of the Dialog component,
        from simple message boxes to complex interactive forms. You'll see how
        dialogs can be configured with different sizes, scrollable content, and
        customized behaviors to suit various user experience requirements.
